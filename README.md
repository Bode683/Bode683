# Hey, I'm Bodelain 👋

Fullstack developer from Yaoundé, Cameroon. I build web apps that actually solve business problems — fast, clean, and useful.

## What I'm Building

**🌐 Network Management**
Figuring out how to build software that reliably manages physical network devices — Cisco Meraki, TP-Link Omada, and everything in between. Harder than it sounds.

**🔬 Smart Apps**
Exploring what's possible when you combine LLMs with real product problems. Built a RAG-based property search tool from the ground up — vector databases, embeddings, and all.

**✍️ Writing**
I write about my journey on Medium — complete tutorials, debugging war stories, things I wish someone had written before I wasted a day on them.

## What I Reach For

Problems interesting enough to lose sleep over, regardless of difficulty.

---

## Background

Math degree turned software engineer. The problem-solving instinct from mathematics never left — it just found a better playground.

Worked remotely with an international team on data pipelines and ML models before fullstack became home.
